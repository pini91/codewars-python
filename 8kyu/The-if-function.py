# Create a function that takes three arguments:

# a value to be evaluated for truthiness.
# a function to execute if the first argument is truthy.
# a function to execute if the first argument is falsy.
# If the first argument evaluates to truthy, call the second argument (a function). If it evaluates to falsy, call the third argument instead (also a function).

# In statically-typed languages, the first argument will be a boolean. In dynamically-typed languages that attribute a truth value to all expressions, it may be of any type.
